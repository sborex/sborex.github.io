                <h2>
                    What's Inside
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Java application available for download is a demo app compiled to demonstrate how the system works. 
                    It contains a number
                    of preconfigured entities which are deployed automatically upon the system start. 
                    Below is a short description of them.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Customer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The customer lifecycle process and a simple phone call interaction algorithm
                    are defined as an executable sequence of blocks. The example below 
                    defines entry points for customer record acquisition and modification and a 
                    conversation plan of a set of questions, infinitely looped for the simplicity of demonstration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The actual process can be of any complexity, contain nested sub-processes, invoke 
                    other processes by starting or signaling them, call external services or publish 
                    services to be called externally.
                    
                </p>


                <p class="w3-card w3-sand w3-padding-large w3-center">
                    <img src="customer.svg" alt="Customer process" style="width: 75%"/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively you may define the customer entity using a 
                    <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/" target="_blank">BPMN</a>-like

                        diagram editor</a>.
                </p>

                <p>                    
                    Below is an example of a customer record representation and a contact dialogue initial form (available 
                    under the hamburger menu button in the upper right corner). Different sections of the customer
                    data are collapsible for convenience.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    The customer data view is designed visually in a view editor:

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Register flowchart is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> 
                    procedure that defines a process of acquiring a customer data file via web or from a filesystem. This flowchart 
                    transforms the incoming data and then passes it to a Customer process, iterating over each line of the input file.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Note the integration points (the circles with an envelope icon) and format transformations that 
                    are serviced by an embedded 
                    <a href="https://camel.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Camel</a> instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Register definition can be edited in

                    The process diagram below demonstrates how a technical service, simple or complex, can be designed in the system. Any of the

                <h3>
                    Session
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a technical process that gets started for each of the new web sessions:
                </p>
                <p class="w3-card w3-sand w3-padding-large w3-center">

                </p>
                <p>
                    With the help of the LDAP integration the process 
                    may query your enterprise user database for roles and permissions, or you may configure access to a custom 
                    user storage, but currently it just stores the username entered by the user in the session context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For demonstration simplicity this process
                    also provides a process editor available to the user right on the app's home page.
                </p>

                    If the ports 8585, 8543 and 5060 are occupied on the host machine, we may override the default 
                    configuration by providing the different port numbers at start time:

                </p>
                <p>
                    If the server stops responding go to the installation directory where your

                    and subfolders inside it except the <span style="font-family: monospace">sborex-poc.jar</span> itself
                    to start the system from scratch.

                <h2>
                    Technical Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is written in Java and is able to run on versions 8+. It doesn't employ the  Spring Boot or Spring whatsoever. 
                    It's not based on any of the opensource BPMN engines out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apache Camel included in the system is of version 2.24.0. It runs an embedded Jetty webserver 
                    for the web pages, rest services and websockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the demo it is configured to run with Derby database, also embedded version. It can be configured to use 
                    PostgreSQL or any other relational database server as its datastore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The awesome <a href="https://bpmn.io/" target="_blank">bpmn.io</a> library is used for displaying and editing the process definitions
                    in BPMN visual format. The native mobile and modern editors are also projected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a thirdparty web page designer that opens by Edit Layout button wherever the element is accompanied with 
                    a web page template. (Please note that it is not yet fully integrated.)
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Status and Prospects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sborex is currently not production ready and requires further technical improvements. 
                    The current version may experience loss of data and performance problems under high load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current process modeler is going to be redesigned and more visual editors added to provide a 
                    real &quot;low code&quot; experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next steps will include embedding the neural 
                    networking solutions and distributed computing for higher loads.
